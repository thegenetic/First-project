            As many states in north India begin their food grain procurement operations and more and more news begin to filter in from rural India, we can see one of the biggest blunders of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown strategy: it might turn India’s biggest asset during this crisis into our biggest liability for a long time to come.<br>

            Agrarian sector can be India’s bulwark against the current Covid-19 crisis. It so happens that rural India is the least affected by the coronavirus in this first wave of viral infection. Rural settlements allow for greater social distancing than clusters of persons of comparable economic status in urban areas. Most agrarian operations require more space than what factories do. Agricultural mandis are more spread out than any other bazaar. So, agriculture was the one sector of our economy that could keep going with relatively lesser risk despite the lockdown. Even when the guidelines did not permit it explicitly, the farmers managed to visit their fields and carry out the pre-harvesting and harvesting operations.

            This year, the agrarian sector was much better placed to support India during the crisis. Luckily, coronavirus arrived when we are comfortably placed in terms of food security. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is sitting on 87 million MT of foodgrain stock. This roughly translates into one sack of 100 kg rice or wheat for every single member of every family that has a ration card in the country. The stock should go up by another 25-30 million MT by the time the current wheat procurement comes to an end. This season happens to be that of a bumper rabi crop, thanks to heavy post-monsoon rains last year. So, we should expect generous addition to our stocks of wheat and easy availability of chana, mustard and masur daal besides seasonal vegetables and milk. The forecast of a normal monsoon comforts us that India can go on for months in the absence of any international trade.

            This is the moment to recognise the value of food sovereignty, something we have come to take for granted. This is the moment to thank the farmers. No, you don’t need thali or taali for that. You just need to ensure that the farmers get a fair price for their produce. That would also be a smart economic move to kickstart the economy, because farmers are more likely to spend, rather than save, their earnings compared to an average urban consumer.
